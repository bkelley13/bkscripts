=> Appending nvm source string to /Users/bokelle/.bashrc
=> Appending bash_completion source string to /Users/bokelle/.bashrc
=> You currently have modules installed globally with `npm`. These will no
=> longer be linked to the active version of Node when you install a new node
=> with `nvm`; and they may (depending on how you construct your `$PATH`)
=> override the binaries of modules installed with `nvm`:

/usr/local/lib
├── @oracle/ojet-cli@8.0.0
├── @oracle/oraclejet-audit@8.0.0
├── generator-code@1.2.7
├── grunt-cli@1.3.2
├── typescript@3.6.3
├── vsce@1.67.1
└── yo@3.1.0
=> If you wish to uninstall them at a later point (or re-install them under your
=> `nvm` Nodes), you can remove them from the system Node as follows:

     $ nvm use system
     $ npm uninstall -g a_module

=> Close and reopen your terminal to start using nvm or run the following to use it now:

export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion
